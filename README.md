## Installation
You can install the CLI Runtime component using [Composer][composer]:

```bash
composer require legatus/runtime-cli
```

## Quick Start

For more details you can check the [online documentation here][docs].

## Project status & release process

While this library is still under development, it is well tested and should be stable enough to use in production environments.

The current releases are numbered 0.x.y. When a non-breaking change is introduced (adding new methods, optimizing existing code, etc.), y is incremented.

When a breaking change is introduced, a new 0.x version cycle is always started.

It is therefore safe to lock your project to a given release cycle, such as 0.2.*.

If you need to upgrade to a newer release cycle, check the [release history][releases] for a list of changes introduced by each further 0.x.0 version.
